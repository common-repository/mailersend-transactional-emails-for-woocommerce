#### Why use MailerSend rather than the emails in WooCommerce?

WooCommerce uses its own native system to send order notifications, but sometimes emails can end up in the spam folder or get delayed. MailerSend takes care of your domain reputation so your emails reach your customers safely. Plus, you get a dashboard that shows you important data about your emails and how their performance can be improved.

#### Is this plugin free?

Yes! And you can send up to 3,000 emails/month with MailerSend for free as well. For a higher volume of emails, you can pick from pay-as-you-go plans without long-term commitments. Premium plans start from $30/month for 50,000 emails/month.
